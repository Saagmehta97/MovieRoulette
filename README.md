## Movie Roulette

I will be focusing on React to try and create a movie generator for a user that has a hard time picking what to watch. 

<strong>MVP Features: </strong>
  - User select a button to generate random popular movie and it will suggest what they should watch
  - User has ability to say no which will generate another movie suggestion

<strong>Stretch goals:</strong>
  - user can filter by type of movie they want to watch
  - compare two movies against each other

<strong>Tech Stack:</strong>
  - Javascript
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - React/Redux
