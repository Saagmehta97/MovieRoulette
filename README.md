## Movie Roulette

I will be focusing on React to try and create a movie generator for a user that has a hard time picking what to watch. 

MVP Features: 
  - User select a button to generate random popular movie and it will suggest what they should watch
  - User has ability to say no which will generate another movie suggestion
  - Stretch goal:
      - user can filter by type of movie they want to watch
      - compare two movies against each other
